# Curriculum Vitae (CV) Project

This project contains the LaTeX source code and compiled PDF for the CV of Muhammad Huzaifa.

## Project Structure

- **Muhammad_Huzaifa.tex**: The main LaTeX source file for the CV.
- **Muhammad_Huzaifa.pdf**: The compiled PDF version of the CV.
- **.gitignore**: Configured to track only `.tex` and `.pdf` files, ignoring all other build artifacts.
- **Muhammad_Huzaifa.aux** and other auxiliary files: These are generated automatically by LaTeX during compilation and are not tracked by git.

## How to Use

1. **Edit the CV**  
   Make changes in the `Muhammad_Huzaifa.tex` file to update your CV content.

2. **Compile the LaTeX File**  
   Use the following command to generate the PDF:
   ```bash
   pdflatex Muhammad_Huzaifa.tex
   ```
   This will produce `Muhammad_Huzaifa.pdf` and several auxiliary files.

3. **Version Control**  
   Only `.tex` and `.pdf` files are tracked in git. All other files (such as `.aux`, `.log`, etc.) are ignored.

## Requirements

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX)

## Notes

- The `.aux` file (like `Muhammad_Huzaifa.aux`) is an auxiliary file generated by LaTeX to store cross-references and other metadata. It is not needed for version control or sharing your CV.
- If you want to add new sections or modify the layout, edit the `.tex` file accordingly.
